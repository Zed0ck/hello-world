# Hello World
Learning project for me. Purpose is to learn how to use GitHub. I also try to learn some coding so it is nice to have a repository where to put some code.

At this point I have been done some HTML pages with bootstrap and one css file for styles. I also added essentials.js where I have common header, navigation and footer.
